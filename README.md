   cd skills
   ```

2. Copy individual skills to your Claude Code skills directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Or install all skills from a category:
   ```bash
   for skill in open-source/*/; do
     cp -r "$skill" ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   done
   ```

### Claude.ai

Skills can be uploaded to Claude.ai following the [Creating Custom Skills guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

### Claude API

Use the [Skills API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) to programmatically load and manage skills in your applications.

## Using Skills

Once installed, Claude will automatically activate relevant skills based on your task. You don't need to explicitly invoke them.

For example, with the `release-post` skill installed:

```
You: Help me write a release post for dplyr 1.2.0

Claude: I'll help you create a release post. First, let me gather some information...
```

Claude will use the skill's knowledge to guide you through creating a properly formatted release post.
