# Contributing to Posit Claude Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Posit Claude Skills repository! This document provides guidelines for creating and submitting new skills.

## Quick Start

1. **Use the skill-creator skill**: We highly recommend using [Anthropic's skill-creator skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) to help you build high-quality skills
1. Check for duplicates: Search existing skills to avoid duplication
1. Follow our structure: Use the directory structure and format described below

## Creating a New Skill

### 1. Choose the Right Category

Determine which category your skill belongs to:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **open-source** | General open-source package development and maintenance |
| **tidyverse** | Tidyverse-specific package development |
| **shiny** | Shiny app development and deployment |
| **quarto** | Quarto document creation and publishing |
| **connect** | Posit Connect deployment and management |


Feel free to propose new categories if needed.

### 2. Skill Structure

Each skill should follow this structure:

```
category-name/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill file
    ├── references/           # Optional: Supporting documentation
    │   └── guide.md
    ├── scripts/              # Optional: Helper scripts
    │   └── helper.sh
    ├── templates/            # Optional: Document templates
    │   └── template.md
    └── README.md             # Optional but recommended: User documentation
```

### 3. SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file is the core of your skill. It must include YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: >
  A clear, concise description of what this skill does and when to use it.
  Focus on the use cases and capabilities. Claude will read this to decide
  when to activate your skill.
---

# Skill Name

[Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this skill]

## When to Use This Skill

- Use case 1
- Use case 2
- Use case 3

## Instructions

[Step-by-step instructions Claude should follow]

## Examples

[Real-world examples showing the skill in action]

## Resources

- Links to relevant documentation
- Helper scripts
- Reference materials
```

### 4. Writing Effective Skill Instructions

**For Claude, not end users**: Write instructions for Claude to follow, not for human users. Think of it as teaching Claude how to help users.

**Be specific and actionable**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that Claude can follow autonomously.

**Include examples**: Show concrete examples of inputs, outputs, and workflows.

**Handle edge cases**: Document how Claude should handle errors, ambiguity, and special situations.

**Reference supporting files**: Use relative paths to reference other files in your skill directory:
```markdown
See `references/formatting-guide.md` for detailed formatting requirements.
```

### 5. Best Practices

- **Focus on real use cases**: Base your skill on actual needs, not hypothetical scenarios
- **Keep it focused**: One skill should do one thing well. If you find yourself adding many unrelated features, consider splitting into multiple skills
- **Provide comprehensive documentation**: Include both Claude-facing instructions (SKILL.md) and user-facing documentation (README.md)
- **Test across platforms**: Verify your skill works in Claude.ai, Claude Code, and via API
- **Use clear naming**: Skill names should be descriptive and use kebab-case
- **Document dependencies**: If your skill requires specific tools or packages, document them clearly
- **Include error handling**: Guide Claude on how to handle common errors

### 6. Using the skill-creator Skill

We **strongly recommend** using [Anthropic's skill-creator skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) to build your skill. This skill provides:

- Guidance on effective skill structure
- Help with writing clear instructions
- Validation of your skill format
- Best practices and examples

To use the skill-creator:

1. Install the skill from Anthropic's repository
2. Start a conversation with Claude about creating your skill
3. Claude will guide you through the process using skill-creator's expertise

## Adding Your Skill to the Repository

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/skills.git
cd skills
```

### 2. Create Your Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p category-name/your-skill-name
cd category-name/your-skill-name
```

### 3. Add Your Skill Files

Create your SKILL.md and any supporting files following the structure above.

### 4. Update marketplace.json

Add your skill to the appropriate category plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

Skills are organized by category plugins. Find the plugin that matches your skill's category and add your skill path to its `skills` array:

```json
{
  "name": "category-skills",
  "description": "Collection of skills for [category purpose]",
  "source": "./",
  "strict": false,
  "skills": [
    "./existing-category/existing-skill",
    "./your-category/your-skill-name"  // Add your skill here
  ]
}
```

**Example**: If you're adding a skill to the open-source category:

```json
{
  "name": "open-source-skills",
  "description": "Collection of skills for general open-source package development and maintenance, including release post creation and changelog management",
  "source": "./",
  "strict": false,
  "skills": [
    "./open-source/release-post",
    "./open-source/your-new-skill"  // Your new skill
  ]
}
```

**If creating a new category**: Add a new plugin entry to the `plugins` array:

```json
{
  "name": "your-category-skills",
  "description": "Collection of skills for [category purpose]",
  "source": "./",
  "strict": false,
  "skills": [
    "./your-category/your-skill-name"
  ]
}
```

### 5. Add a Category README (if new category)

If you're adding a new category directory, include a README.md:

```markdown
# Category Name Skills

Brief description of what skills in this category do.

## Available Skills

- **[skill-name](./skill-name/)** - Brief description

## Common Use Cases

- Use case 1
- Use case 2
```

### 6. Test Your Skill

Before submitting:

1. **Install locally**:
   ```bash
   cp -r category-name/your-skill-name ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   ```

2. **Test with Claude Code**: Verify Claude activates your skill appropriately

3. **Test edge cases**: Try various inputs and scenarios

4. **Check formatting**: Ensure YAML frontmatter is valid and markdown is well-formatted

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

Open a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Clear description of what the skill does
- Test results showing it works
- Any dependencies or requirements
- Links to related issues (if applicable)

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Required Information

Your PR description should include:

- **Purpose**: What does this skill do?
- **Use cases**: When would someone use this skill?
- **Testing**: How did you test it? What scenarios did you try?
- **Dependencies**: Does it require any specific tools, packages, or configurations?
- **Documentation**: Is the skill well-documented for both Claude and users?
